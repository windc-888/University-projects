# ðŸ‘§Children's Mental Health Analysis ProjectðŸ§’ 

## Description
In this project, I analysed the mental health scores of children accross England to investigate any variation in scores accross various regions in England as well as throughout the years from 2015-2020. This project was written with R. This repo contains the "Child_mental_health_report.pdf" file which describes my data, analysis methods, findings and discussion in more detail. The .pdf was published using R markdown, the source-code of which being the "Child_mental_health_analysis_source_code.Rmd" file. This repo also contains all the files necessary to perform the analysis, including the mental health scores data ("datadownload.xlsx") and England shapefiles required to produce the figures in the report. 

*Note:* This repo also contains the file "raw_script.R", which is the raw R script used to perfrom the analysis.
